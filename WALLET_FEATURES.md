# Wallet & Withdrawal Features

## Overview
This document describes the wallet and withdrawal functionality implemented for the Cash Karma application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Balance Management
- **Pending Balance Display**: Shows current pending balance in rupees
- **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator showing progress toward ₹30 withdrawal threshold
- **Threshold Messaging**: Clear messaging when under withdrawal threshold
- **Grayed Out Button**: Withdrawal button is disabled with tooltip when under threshold

### 2. Withdrawal Flow
- **"Withdraw Now" Button**: Bright, pulsing button when active
- **UPI Payout Modal**: Multi-step modal with destination verification
- **Instant UPI Messaging**: "Instant UPI payout - No extra fee - Takes 10 seconds"
- **Success Animation**: Confetti animation on successful withdrawal
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for failed payouts

### 3. Database Schema
- **wallets table**: Stores user balance information
- **withdrawals table**: Tracks withdrawal transaction history
- **user_payout_methods table**: Stores UPI IDs and verification status
- **Triggers**: Automatic wallet updates when drops are paid

### 4. Components Created

#### WalletBalance.tsx
- Displays pending balance with progress bar
- Shows withdrawal threshold progress
- Handles withdrawal button states
- Real-time balance updates

#### WithdrawalModal.tsx
- Multi-step withdrawal process
- UPI ID validation and verification
- Processing states with loading animations
- Success/error states with appropriate messaging
- Confetti animation on success

#### TransactionHistory.tsx
- Displays withdrawal history
- Status indicators (completed, failed, processing)
- Transaction details with timestamps
- Empty state handling

#### WalletPage.tsx
- Main wallet interface
- Combines balance, withdrawal, and history
- Tabbed interface for organization
- Statistics overview

#### ConfettiAnimation.tsx

### 5. Services

#### WalletService
- Balance management
- Withdrawal processing
- UPI ID validation
- Transaction history
- Razorpay integration (simulated)

### 6. Integration Requirements

#### Razorpay Payouts API
- Simulated integration in `WalletService.processRazorpayPayout()`
- Real implementation would use Razorpay's Payouts API
- Handles UPI transfers to user accounts

#### Supabase Database
- Real-time balance updates
- Transaction history tracking
- User payout method storage
- Automatic triggers for wallet updates

## Usage

### Accessing the Wallet
1. Navigate to the main application
2. Click the "Wallet" button in the navigation tabs
3. View your balance and withdrawal options

### Making a Withdrawal
1. Ensure you have at least ₹30 in pending balance
2. Click "Withdraw Now" button
3. Enter withdrawal amount (minimum ₹30)
4. Enter your UPI ID (format: name@bank)
5. Confirm the transaction
6. Wait for processing (simulated 10 seconds)
7. Receive success confirmation with confetti

### Viewing Transaction History
1. Navigate to the wallet page
2. Click on "Transaction History" tab
3. View all past withdrawals with status indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Database Migration
The wallet functionality requires the following database tables:
- `wallets`: User balance storage
- `withdrawals`: Transaction history
- `user_payout_methods`: UPI ID storage

### Environment Variables
For production, you'll need:
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`: Razorpay API key
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`: Razorpay API secret
- `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Webhook verification secret

### API Integration
The current implementation simulates Razorpay payouts. For production:
1. Replace `processRazorpayPayout()` with actual Razorpay API calls
2. Implement webhook handling for payment status updates
3. Add proper error handling for API failures

## Security Considerations

### UPI ID Validation
- Basic format validation: `name@bank`
- Server-side validation before processing
- Rate limiting on withdrawal attempts

### Transaction Security
- All transactions are logged in database
- Failure reasons are tracked
- Balance updates are atomic operations

### User Privacy
- UPI IDs are stored securely
- Transaction history is user-specific
- No sensitive data exposed in logs

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Multiple Payout Methods**: Support for bank transfers, cards
2. **Scheduled Withdrawals**: Automatic withdrawals at set intervals
3. **Withdrawal Limits**: Daily/monthly withdrawal limits
4. **KYC Integration**: Identity verification for large withdrawals
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed earnings and withdrawal analytics

### Technical Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live balance updates
2. **Offline Support**: Cache wallet data for offline viewing
3. **Push Notifications**: Notify users of successful withdrawals
4. **Multi-currency**: Support for different currencies
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for fraud detection

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create drops to accumulate balance
2. Test withdrawal flow with valid UPI ID
3. Test error scenarios (insufficient balance, invalid UPI)
4. Verify transaction history updates
5. Test confetti animation

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for WalletService methods
- Integration tests for database operations
- E2E tests for withdrawal flow
- Performance tests for large transaction volumes

## Deployment Notes

### Database Setup
1. Run the wallet migration: `supabase/migrations/20250102000000_wallet_withdrawal_features.sql`
2. Verify RLS policies are active
3. Test database triggers

### Environment Configuration
1. Set up Razorpay credentials
2. Configure webhook endpoints
3. Set up monitoring for failed transactions

### Monitoring
1. Monitor withdrawal success rates
2. Track average withdrawal amounts
3. Alert on failed transactions
4. Monitor API response times

## Support

For issues with wallet functionality:
1. Check transaction logs in Supabase
2. Verify Razorpay API status
3. Review user's withdrawal history
4. Check balance calculations

## Contributing

When adding new wallet features:
1. Update database schema with migrations
2. Add TypeScript types for new tables
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation
